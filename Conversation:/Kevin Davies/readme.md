Why don't we make a Feature:
Where important places you visit with the Falconer? Get converted to a VR scene in real time, While you're there. It would work like a series of waypoints. And the users can choose whichever "Virtual meeting place" they prefer to chat in and chat with users and other ones who are teleported. And they would have your video streams up in the main window but the surroundings would be one of those places. And the chat would be Auto speech to text conversion and you could get super chats as voice or video clips from the users. And play or read them live..
